# coding-problems
Since one of the most important parts of trying to get a job in programming is to test your coding skills solving different problems, I thought it would be interesting
to upload the solutions to some of the problems that I've solved on coding challenge platforms like HackerRank, Codewars or LeetCode.
The solutions are mainly written in C++, but other languages can be expected for specific problems.
