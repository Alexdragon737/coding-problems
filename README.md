# DISCLAIMER - You should not use these solutions to cheat on the coding problems platforms, interviews and anything like that. 
You won't gain anything besides an increased number of solved problems which will give you a false sense of hope. Solve these problems yourself if you really want to prove something.

# Why does this repo exist?
Since one of the most important parts of trying to get a job in programming is to test your coding skills solving different problems, I thought it would be interesting
to upload the solutions to some of the problems that I've solved on coding challenge platforms like HackerRank, Codewars or LeetCode.
The solutions are mainly written in C++, but other languages can be expected for specific problems.
